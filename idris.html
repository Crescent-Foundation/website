    <hr>
    <p>Prophet Idris (AS) is one of the earliest prophets sent by Allah ﷻ to guide humanity. He lived many generations before Prophet Noah (AS) and is respected for his wisdom, knowledge, and deep devotion to Allah. Although the Qur’an does not provide many details about his life, Islamic tradition honors Idris (AS) as a great teacher and role model.


Allah gave Idris (AS) special knowledge that was not known to many people at that time. He is believed to have been the first person to write with a pen and to teach others how to write and record information. This knowledge helped humans to preserve their history, laws, and learning, which greatly advanced civilization.


Idris (AS) was also known for his patience and worship. He was devoted to Allah and spent much of his life in prayer and reflection. Because of his strong faith and righteous deeds, Allah elevated Idris (AS) to a high place—some traditions say he was raised to the heavens as a reward for his devotion.


Prophet Idris (AS) taught people to be patient during difficult times, to seek knowledge, and to remain faithful no matter what challenges they faced. His example reminds us that worship is not just about rituals but also about constant dedication and striving to be better.
