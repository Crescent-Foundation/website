    <h1>The Story of Prophet Adam (AS) – What We Can Learn</h1>
  </header>


  <section>
    <hr>
    <p>Prophet Adam (AS) is the very first human being created by Allah ﷻ and also the first prophet. Allah created Adam from clay and gave him life, making him special among all creatures.


Allah taught Adam many important things, including the names of all things — this was a great honor and showed how knowledgeable and wise Adam was. Allah then commanded the angels to bow down to Adam out of respect. All angels obeyed except one — Iblis, a jinn who was proud and refused. Iblis said he was better because he was made from fire while Adam was made from clay. Because of this arrogance, Iblis was cast out of Paradise.


Adam (AS) and his wife, Hawwa (Eve), lived in Paradise. Allah allowed them to enjoy everything there except one tree. But Iblis tricked them into eating from it by whispering lies, promising they would become like angels if they ate its fruit.


When Adam and Hawwa ate from the forbidden tree, they made a mistake. But they immediately felt sorry and asked Allah for forgiveness. They said, “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will be losers.” (Surah Al-A’raf 7:23)


Allah forgave them, but He sent them down to Earth to live and learn. This is where the human story truly begins.

<section><p>Allah is Merciful: Even when we make mistakes, sincere repentance can bring forgiveness.


Humility is Important: Pride and arrogance, like Iblis’s, lead to downfall.


We Are Responsible for Our Actions: Adam and Hawwa accepted their mistake and turned to Allah.


Life is a Test: Earth is a place to learn, grow, and seek Allah’s guidance.
